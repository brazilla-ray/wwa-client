William Whitaker is a painter living and working in Washington, DC. His work explores the connection between artist and viewer through visual experience. With a minimal range of marks, Whitaker's paintings seek to move beyond imagery and language, and to engage with the viewer as an equal participant in the creation of meaning. His work was recently included in 'Strictly Painting 12', an exhibition at the McLean Project for the Arts of painters from across the mid-Atlantic region, curated by Adah Rose Bitterbaum. He gave a talk about his work this past fall at the National Gallery of Art, as part of the 'Works in Progress' lecture series, his second time participating in that program.
